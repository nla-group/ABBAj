ABBAj is a Julia module for time series transformation with ABBA. With ABBAj, you can employ ABBA in an efficient way to symbolize time series and applied the symbolic representation to the downstream time series task such as classification and forecasting. Compared to the ABBA module, ABBAj enjoys significantly faster speed while retaining the consistent reconstruction error of representation.
